# EV_Vehicle_Charge_Demand
Predicting future electric vehicle (EV) adoption is crucial for responsive infrastructure planning — especially for charging networks, grid capacity, and sustainable transportation systems. This project forecasts EV adoption trends using historical registration data for Washington State counties.

Electric vehicle usage continues to grow rapidly. Urban planners, utility companies, and policymakers need accurate forecasts to:
Estimate future EV counts
Anticipate charging station demand
Optimize energy and infrastructure resources
This repository uses machine learning regression models to forecast EV adoption based on historical trends from 2017–2024.
